## What is a Keylogger?

A **keylogger** is a program that records the keys you press on your keyboard.  
It‚Äôs commonly used for:
- Debugging keyboard input
- Usability testing
- Parental control (with consent)
- Learning how system hooks work

---

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

This simple Python keylogger:
- Runs in the background
- Listens for each key press
- Saves every key to a text file (`key_log.txt`)
- Stops safely when you press `ESC`

The program uses the [`pynput`](https://pypi.org/project/pynput/) library, which allows Python to monitor keyboard events.

## Works On

- Windows  
- Linux (with X11; **not** fully supported on Wayland)  
- macOS (with appropriate permissions)

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pynput` library
- (Linux only) `python3-xlib` if needed

---

## Installation

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mz-mukhtar/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
cd PRODIGY_CS_04
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
# Install pynput
pip install pynput

# For Linux: Xlib dependency
# (only if you get X errors)
sudo apt-get install python3-xlib
```

---

## How to use it

```bash
python3 keylogger.py
```
---

## Ethical Use

This tool is for:

- Learning how keyboard hooks work
- Practicing Python event handling
- Developing legitimate input-monitoring tools (e.g. hotkey apps)

Never use it to spy on others.
